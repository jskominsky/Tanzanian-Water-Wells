## Overview
In Tanzania, 4 million people lack access to safe water according to water.org (https://water.org/our-impact/where-we-work/tanzania/#:~:text=4%20million%20people%20in%20Tanzania,long%20distances%20to%20collect%20water.).  They mainly rely on water wells for access to clean drinking water, however many of the water wells in Tanzania are not functional.  My goal is to build a predictive model, using classification models, for the charity, The Tanzania Water Project, to predict whether a water well is functional or non functional.
